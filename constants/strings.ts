    "about": "Hi, my name is Harrison Duval. I was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. My mom is a Peruvian immigrant, " +
        "and latinx culture was a big part of my upbringing. I am a senior at Vanderbilt University, majoring in " +
        "computer science. I am an aspiring software engineer with experience developing full-stack applications. " +
        "I have the most experience programming in Java, JavaScript (React), and C++.",
    "work": "My work experience has come from my two summer internships as a software developer at Amazon. During my " +
        "time as an intern, I received the opportunity to tackle two customer impacting projects. My first project " +
        "was mostly backend work, where I used AWS Step Functions, Lambda, Glue, SNS, SQS, S3, and DynamoDB to " +
        "offer customers the ability to remove ASIN and Brand ID mappings from items in the Amazon catalog. During my " +
        "second internship, I had the opportunity to develop a full stack application that allows users to search " +
        "various databases for historical data on all ASIN and Brand ID mappings submitted to the Amazon catalog. I " +
        "accomplished this by setting up multiple REST API endpoints for each search type. I implemented the server " +
        "side as a Spring Boot application that queries the databases when the relevant endpoints are hit. I built " +
        "the frontend using React routing, components, and hooks. Throughout both of these internships I improved " +
        "my technical skills, and my understanding of cloud computing. Furthermore, I grew a lot as a person and " +
        "professionally by learning how to deal with ambiguous situations and developed more patience.",
    "hobbies": "Soccer has been one of my strongest passions since childhood. I grew up playing recreational soccer " +
        "with my friends and joined my middle school soccer team with them. In high school, I began to take it more " +
        "seriously and decided to hone my skills by joining the local club team. My goal was to make my school's " +
        "highly competitive varsity team. By the end of my sophomore year, I had achieved this goal and joined the " +
        "team. This taught me the important life lesson of working hard to achieve my goals. In my senior year, we " +
        "won the state championship, and it was a very proud moment for me. My other hobbies include watching " +
        "soccer, and my favorite club is Tottenham Hotspur. While growing up, I also enjoyed playing video games " +
        "with my friends, as it was a fun way to socialize with them outside of school. As I've grown older, I have " +
        "struggled to find the time to play these games, but I still occasionally play Football Manager, FIFA, " +
        "CS:GO, Overwatch, and League of Legends."
